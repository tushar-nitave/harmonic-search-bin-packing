# harmonic-search-bin-packing
##### Harmonic search is NIC algorithm used for optimization. Harmonic search method is inspired from harmony improvisition used in music composition. It uses the Harmony Memory which is nothing but multidimentional array containing random solutions. There are two operators Harmonic Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR)— defined as probability of selecting a component from present harmonic memory and Pitch Adjusting Rate (PAR)— determines the probability of candidate from the harmonic memory to be mutated. 
### Four steps of harmonic search method
##### 1. Initialization of the harmonic memory (HM): Initially harmonic memory consists of number of randomly generated solution to the optimization probelm.
##### 2. Improvising a new solution from the HM.
